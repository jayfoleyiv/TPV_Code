This is a copy of spectral plot specifically for computing the thermal emission, spectral efficiency, and 
spectral density of the non-regular Bragg Reflector provided by the vendor.

The details of that bragg reflector are as follows:
          d[2] = 0.2324;  (SiO2)
          d[3] = 0.1687;  (TiO2)
          d[4] = 0.2119;  (SiO2)
          d[5] = 0.162;   (TiO2)
